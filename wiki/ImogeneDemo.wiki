= Introduction =

	The Information System that is presented is a demonstration Information System that has been generated thanks to the _*imogene*_ development studio.
	This given Information System deals with the collection of epidemiological data. But it could have been any other kind of activity type since _*imogene*_ modeling capabilities are generic.
	The presented data model does not correspond to a real use case. The forms and fields have been defined to illustrate the different features that can be modeled thanks to _*imogene*_.

	== Architecture ==

	The demonstration IS illustrates the collection of data through Android mobile terminals and the bidirectionnal data synchronization between the mobile terminals and a central database.
	It includes:
		* *A Web application* to collect, view and analyse the data from anywhere as far as an internet connection is available.
		* *An Android Mobile application* to collect and consult data in mobility situations. It works both in connected and disconnected mode. 
		* *A Synchronization server* to synchronize the data between the mobile application and the Information System central database.

	== Model ==
	
	The data model that has been defined to generate the demonstration IS can be downloaded [http://imogene.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/demo/ImogeneDemoModel.zip here].
	The published applications directly result from the _*imogene*_ application generation process. No additional programming work has been done. This shows the set of features that are available as a basis within _*imogene*_.
	Of course some customization can be done on the applications. _*imogene*_ makes it easy to display a specific logo instead of the _*imogene*_ one. Colors and icons can be configured in the data model too. Finally, the generation process provides the source code of the applications and from there they can be customized. 

	== Access ==
	
		=== Web application ===
		
		The Web application is accessible at the URL: [http://demo.i-mogene.org http://demo.i-mogene.org]
		
		=== Android application ===
		
		The Android application can be downloaded and installed from the terminal.
		In addition to the generated demonstration application, an additional mapping module can be installed on the terminal to be able to display the collected data on a map on the terminal.
		
		These applications are available at the following links:

		=== Login/Password ===	
		
		3 different users with different user privileges have been defined in the system.
		
		==== System Administrator ====
		
		* login: sysadmin
		* password: sysadmin
		
		This type of user would be the system administrator.
		He would use only the web application for data management.
		He has access to all the data in read and write mode. He can build the lookup tables that the other users will use while collecting data.
	
		==== Investigator ====
		
		* login: investigator
		* password: investigator
		
		This type of user would be the staff that goes on the field to collect data in mobility situation.
		He would use the Android application when he is on the field of operation. He could use also the web application to check or complete data.
		He has access to all the data in read and write mode except for the lookup tables.
		
		==== Public User ====
		
		* login: readonly
		* password: readonly
		
		This type of user would be the people who need to access the data to be able to perform analysis but who should not modify it.
		He would use mainly the web application for data access. He could also use the Android application to access the data in mobility situation.
		He has access to the data only in read mode and some confidential data are hidden to him.
