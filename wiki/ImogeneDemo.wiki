= Introduction =

	The Information System that is presented is a demonstration Information System that has been generated thanks to the _*imogene*_ development studio.
	This given Information System deals with the collection of epidemiological data. But it could have been any other kind of activity type since _*imogene*_ modeling capabilities are generic.
	The presented data model does not correspond to a real use case. The forms and fields have been defined to illustrate the different features that can be modeled thanks to _*imogene*_.

	The demonstration IS illustrates the collection of data through Android mobile terminals and the bidirectionnal data synchronization between the mobile terminals and a central database.
	It includes:
	* *A Web application* to collect, view and analyse the data from anywhere as far as an internet connection is available.
	* *An Android Mobile application* to collect and consult data in mobility situations. It works both in connected and disconnected mode. 
	* *A Synchronization server* to synchronize the data between the mobile application and the Information System central database.

	== Model ==
	
	The data model that has been defined to generate the demonstration IS can be downloaded [http://imogene.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/demo/ImogeneDemoModel.zip here]
	The publiched applications directly result from the _*imogene*_ application generation process. No additional programming work has been done. This was done on purpose to show the set of features that are available as a basis within _*imogene*_.
	Of course some customization can be done on the applications. _*imogene*_ makes it easy to display a any kind of logo instead of the _*imogene*_ logos. Colors and icons can be configured in the data model. The generation process provides the source code of the applications that can be customized. 

	== Access ==
	
	=== Web application ===
	
	The Web application is accessible at the URL: [http://demo.i-mogene.org http://demo.i-mogene.org]
