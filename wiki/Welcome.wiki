= Welcome to imogene =

	_*imogene*_ is an Open Source *Rapid Application Development Studio* for Data Collection Information Systems.

	Through an [http://www.android.com/ Android client] and a synchronization server, _*imogene*_ offers the ability to quickly deploy a mobile information system. Thanks to its advanced features, _*imogene*_ particularly fits for *surveillance system*, where data needs not only to be collected but also to be regularly updated.

	_*imogene*_ is specifically designed for *data managers* who do not have advanced development skills but who need to quickly generate modern and efficient information systems. Because all functionalities implementation are provided through the studio, _*imogene*_ users just need to focus on the data model creation to have their *applications automatically generated*.

	_*imogene*_ is basicaly a set of [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse] plugin. It takes advantage of the code already developed in renowned existing open source projects like [http://www.springsource.org/ Spring], [http://www.hibernate.org/ Hibernate], [http://tomcat.apache.org/ Apache Tomcat] or [http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/ Google Web tool Kit].

	The generated Information Systems include the following functionalities:

      === Data collection: ===
        * The data collection/consultation in mobile situations (create/search/update)
        * The ability to collect data in connected or disconnected mode
        * The data storage in a central relational database
        * The automatic data synchronization between the applications running in connected/disconnected mode and the central database
        * The collection/consultation/analysis of the data from anywhere via a Web interface.
        * The collection, transmission and storage of binary data (photo, sound, video, etc)
        * The use of bar code (including [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_Code/ QR code])
        * The acquisition of GPS coordinates
      === User Notification: ===
        * The ability to automatically send to users alerts or messages (SMS, Email or pop-up windows displayed in the web interface) when specific events occur in the system (alert a user when a given form is created, when x forms with a field having a given value are entered in the system, etc).
      === User privilege management: ===
        * The ability to manage user privileges based on users and roles associations.
      === Internationalization: ===
        * The ability to provide internationalized user interfaces.
      === Interoperability: ===
        * The ability to communicate with existing Information Systems. This interoperability is based on web services that enable communication between applications.
      === Remote update: ===
        * The IS applications are based on technologies and follow development standards that enable a remote update of the deployed applications.
